# YOLO-implementation-for-object-detection

# Description:
**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a high-speed, real-time object detection system that detects multiple objects in a single pass of a convolutional neural network. In this project, we use a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect objects in an image and draw bounding boxes around them.

# ðŸ“¦ What This Project Demonstrates:
* Loads a YOLOv5 model for real-time object detection

* Detects and labels multiple objects with confidence scores

* Draws bounding boxes over detected items in an image
